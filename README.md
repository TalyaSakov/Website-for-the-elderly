# Website for the elderly
I my site, I put a lot of emphasis on website design and incorporating special elements such as:
* Animation in the site title
* I designed the backgrounds and titles in Photoshop and procreate
* For the email sending form I saw fit to have a button that links in favor of the action and that the form would not simply be displayed as part of the site.
